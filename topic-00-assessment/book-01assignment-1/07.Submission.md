Late submissions will incur a 15% penalty per each day late unless the student has been in touch with the lecturer at least 2 days before the submission time/date to look for an extension. Where this extension has been granted, the lecturer will be in touch with regard to an updated deadline. 


## Where

## File naming convention

Your files should be contained in a **folder** named  according to the rule: 

- *First name* + *Second name*, e.g. Donald Duck's folder would be called *DonaldDuck*. 

You should then compress (zip) the **folder** that contains all the sketches used to develop your assignment; this is the file that you should submit.

**Note:** Only .zip or .7z files will be accepted for submisison.
