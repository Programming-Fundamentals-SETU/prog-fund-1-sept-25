# Assignment 1 

This is your first assignment that will contribute to your grade for the semester.  It is worth **40%** of your overall grade. It is based on what was covered on the first 6 weeks (talks, labs - steps, exercises, and challenges). You won't need to use anything else, in fact using code not covered will mean you fall foul of the **constraints** with implications for your score.



You are asked to write code to produce a working animation of your choice. You will be asked to do this using particular elements of code you have learned so far. You will also be asked not to use particular elements. More details in tab on Specification

Please take the time to read all the information given.

While many can get by doing just the labs, most canâ€™t. Engage in your labs, lectures and learner community.


This following will be detailed, for your first assignment:

 - *Advice:* how to approach the assignment
 - *Specification:* What is expected from your code.
 - *Constraints:* Language elements that you are restricted from using in this assignment.
 - *Marking/Rubric:* The marking scheme for the assignment.
 - *ReadMe:* Template to be used for your readme 
 - *Reflection* Template to be used for reflection
 - *Submission:* Submission details including submission date.

 
**NOTE You write the code so that you can reflect on your work.**

**We mark your REFLECTION which references your code.**
