# Reflection tab / file

You must carry out your own self assessment on your work and show this by including a **reflection** tab in the sketch.  Use the detailed analytical rubric to reflect on the work you've done, and critically assess yourself accordingly. You must assign marks for each section.

In marking your work we will only look at the sections you point us to in your reflection. Don't expect us to assign any marks if you don't complete the reflection. Therefore, allow plenty of time to complete it properly.

I would suggest that you finish all coding before completing the reflection.
You should have selected **Edit | Auto Format** previously and added your code comments already.

Detail for each row of the rubric, examples that you used in your code, what they are used for, and line numbers where they can be found. Unless otherwise stated a max of 3 examples is enough for each element. You don't need to be exhaustive.

In the starter template below change the Xs to numbers
modify line numbers to match your code

You don't need to provide an exhaustive list of every occurance but you should give **at least** enough examples to try achieve the mark you are aiming for (this will be clear from the detailed analytical rubric). 

TIP:
Right click | show usage
Right click | show declaration


The template below is a sample of how you might fill in the reflection.
Please refer to the *detailed rubric* in the **Marking-Rubric** tab. Don't just use the template below, as further comment is required. 

You must mark yourself.
You must supply evidence for those marks.

Name : 

Student Number:

Part A - Mark (X /9)
-----------------------------

Comments - 0/1
indented/formatted - 0/1 
naming - 0/1
inclusion of Readme - 0/1 
inclusion of completed Reflection - 0/5


Part B - Mark (X /6)
-----------------------------

line xx Sizing 0/1

line XX - draw()  0/3
line XX - setup()  0/2

** THIS FOLLOWING SECTIONS ARE INCOMPLETE
YOU WILL NEED TO COMPLETE THEM  YOURSELF **


Part C - Mark (X /10)
-----------------------------
Use of if statements:

line xx shows if ..
line xx shows nested if..

Part D - Mark (X/20)
-----------------------------

line xx - loop using for
  :
line xx - nested loop using for
line xx - nested loop using while 


Part E - Mark (0/20)
-----------------------------

line xx - method 1 - shows no parameters etc. 
   :
line xx - method x - (e.g. return value, 3 parameters )

Part F - Mark (0/10)
-----------------------------

line xx - use of Processing function x1 ..
   :
line xx - use of Processing function xn

Part G - Mark (0/10)
-----------------------------

line xx - use of mouse function x1 ..
   :
line xx - use of mouse function xn

Part H - Mark (0/10)
-----------------------------

line xx - use of string, string  function x1 ..
   :
line xx - use of string function xn

Part I - Mark (0/5)
-----------------------------

comments here with some line numbers if that helps. 

Overall mark (0/100)
-----------------------------
Show number components and total here  (e.g. 3+2+5+6+20+16+5+6+4= 61)


** DONâ€™T FORGET TO TOTAL UP OR WE WILL TOO ** 

This will be multiplied by a mark out of 10 for complexity of the problem you tackled. E.g. 10/10 = *1
(We will decide on that)

This will be multiplied by a mark out of 10 for your interview. 

*** Constraints ***
Ignoring the constraints results in the equivalent of scoring 3/10 = .3 for interview
