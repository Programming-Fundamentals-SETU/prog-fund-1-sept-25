# Marking Scheme


There are three components to your overall mark:

- Functionality of the code
- Extra Credit
- Interview mark

# Functionality of the Code  (100 Marks)

# Extra Credit (maximum grade of 100%)

All extra credit is only available if all specified functionality is attempted.  Please note, with extra credit marks, your grade cannot exceed a maximum of 100%.


## Extra functionality bonus

An extra 10% will be available if you include extra functionality e.g.: 

- adding in extra functionality.
- checking that no two student ids added are the same (no duplicate ids)
- etc.

For example, if your grade was 70% and you added some extra credit functionality worth 6%, your final grade would be 76% (interview dependent).



# Interview Mark (10 Marks) 

You will be asked to explain your work. This is to ensure that the work is your own. You may be asked (for example) to explain:

- Any of the code.
- The effect of changing values in the for loop.
- How specific methods work. 
- Etc.

If you do not present for your interview you will receive 0 for the interview and 0% overall. This means you **must** be available for interview. 

If you use code other than from lectures (e.g. from StackOverFlow), you should **always** reference it. Failure to do so will lead to a zero mark. 


# How is the final mark calculated?
 
The final mark is calculated using the following formula:

(((Functionality of Code + Extra Functionality Credit) ) * Interview Mark) / 10

 Example:
 
 - Functionality of code = 70/100
 - Extra Functionality Credit = 6/10
 - Interview Mark = 9/10
 - Final mark = ((70 + 6)  * 9) / 10 = 68.4%
