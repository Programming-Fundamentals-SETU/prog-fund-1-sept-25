This project is a further enhancement of zuul-with-timelimit.
This version also includes a beamer as suggested in exercise 8.43.

The user has a beamer. When you charge a beamer it memorizes the current room. 
When you fire the beamer, it transports you immediately back to the room it was
 charged in.
