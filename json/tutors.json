You will also learn to use variables, different data types, manipulate the data, logical operators and methods.  \nThen we will progress to more complex problems that will briefly introduce you to object-oriented programming and data structures.  You will do a deeper dive into both of these areas in the semester 2 module, Programming Fundamentals 2.","frontMatter":{},"id":"prog-fund-1-sept-25","img":"https://{{COURSEURL}}/course.png","imgFile":"course.png","video":"","videoids":{"videoid":"","videoIds":[]},"hide":false,"los":[{"route":"/topic/{{COURSEURL}}/topic-00-assessment","type":"topic","title":" Assessment","summary":"Details of all assessment in this module.","contentMd":"# Assessment\n\nDetails of all assessment in this module.","frontMatter":{},"id":"topic-00-assessment","img":"https://{{COURSEURL}}/topic-00-assessment/topic.jpg","imgFile":"topic.jpg","video":"","videoids":{"videoid":"","videoIds":[]},"hide":false,"los":[{"route":"/topic/{{COURSEURL}}/topic-00-assessment/","type":"unit","title":"Assesment Schedule","summary":"Assesment Schedule","contentMd":"Assesment Schedule","frontMatter":{},"id":"unit-1","img":"","imgFile":"","video":"","videoids":{"videoid":"","videoIds":[]},"hide":false,"los":[{"route":"/paneltalk/{{COURSEURL}}/topic-00-assessment/unit-1/paneltalk-schedule","type":"paneltalk","title":"Assessment Schedule","summary":"","contentMd":"Assessment Schedule\n\n","frontMatter":{"icon":{"type":"icon-park-twotone:schedule","color":"green"}},"id":"paneltalk-schedule","img":"https://{{COURSEURL}}/topic-00-assessment/unit-1/paneltalk-schedule/agenda.png","imgFile":"agenda.png","video":"","videoids":{"videoid":"","videoIds":[]},"hide":false,"pdf":"https://{{COURSEURL}}/topic-00-assessment/unit-1/paneltalk-schedule/aass_schedule.pdf","pdfFile":"aass_schedule.pdf"}]},{"route":"/topic/{{COURSEURL}}/topic-00-assessment/","type":"unit","title":" Assessment","summary":"Details of each assessment in this module.","contentMd":"# Assessment\n\nDetails of each assessment in this module.","frontMatter":{},"id":"unit-2","img":"","imgFile":"","video":"","videoids":{"videoid":"","videoIds":[]},"hide":false,"los":[{"route":"/talk/{{COURSEURL}}/topic-00-assessment/unit-2/talk-1-in-class-test","type":"talk","title":"In Class Test (40%) ","summary":"Details of in-class test.","contentMd":"In Class Test (40%) \n\nDetails of in-class test. \n\n","frontMatter":{"icon":{"type":"streamline-freehand:edit-pen-write-paper","color":"green"}},"id":"talk-1-in-class-test","img":"https://{{COURSEURL}}/topic-00-assessment/unit-2/talk-1-in-class-test/a-class-test-1.jpg","imgFile":"a-class-test-1.jpg","video":"","videoids":{"videoid":"","videoIds":[]},"hide":false,"pdf":"https://{{COURSEURL}}/topic-00-assessment/unit-2/talk-1-in-class-test/a-class-test.pdf","pdfFile":"a-class-test.pdf"},{"route":"/talk/{{COURSEURL}}/topic-00-assessment/unit-2/talk-2-programming-assignment","type":"talk","title":"Programming Assignment","summary":"Specification, Marking Scheme and due dates.","contentMd":"Programming Assignment\n\nSpecification, Marking Scheme and due dates.\n\n","frontMatter":{"icon":{"type":"streamline-freehand:learning-programming-flag","color":"green"}},"id":"talk-2-programming-assignment","img":"https://{{COURSEURL}}/topic-00-assessment/unit-2/talk-2-programming-assignment/b-prog-ass.jpg","imgFile":"b-prog-ass.jpg","video":"","videoids":{"videoid":"","videoIds":[]},"hide":false,"pdf":"https://{{COURSEURL}}/topic-00-assessment/unit-2/talk-2-programming-assignment/b-prog-ass.pdf","pdfFile":"b-prog-ass.pdf"}]}]},{"route":"/topic/{{COURSEURL}}/topic01-intro-to-module","type":"topic","title":" 1: Introduction to Module and Java","summary":"module  -

We will use the RGB colours to select a colour.  All shapes that are drawn after the **fill** function is called, will be filled with the chosen colour.  \n\nThe syntax of the RGB **fill** function is similar to the **background** function and is:\n\n~~~\n    fill(r,g,b)\n        r = red colour (a whole number between 0 and 255 inclusive)\n        g = green colour (a whole number between 0 and 255 inclusive)\n        b = blue colour (a whole number between 0 and 255 inclusive)\n~~~\n\nIn your open sketchbook, enter the following code just before you draw any shapes:\n\n~~~\n    fill(100,150,70);\n~~~\n\nRun your code; all your shapes should be coloured dark green.\n\n![Shapes filled with dark green colours](./img/20.png)\n\nNow we will set the ellipses to be a different colour i.e. light green.

Only the second ellipse is coloured light green.   \n\nMove the ellipse function back to it's original location so both ellipses are coloured light green.\n\n\n## noStroke() function\n\nA **stroke** is the outline of a shape.

The chosen thickness will apply to all lines/shapes that are drawn after the function is called.  The thickness is specified in pixels and the default thickness is 1 pixel.\n\nIf we wanted **all** shapes to have thickness of 3 pixels, enter the following code before you draw any of the shapes:\n\n~~~\n    strokeWeight(3);\n~~~\n\nYour output should look similar to this:\n\n![Playing with stroke weight](./img/24.png)\n\n##Code so far\n\nThe code that produced the above screen shot is below.
